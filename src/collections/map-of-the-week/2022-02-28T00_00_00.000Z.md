review: |-
  The great pattern variety, representation and use of walls combine to immerse you in the music and make you dance! The very nice lightshow and well-spaced full difficulty spread also make this map shine!
  Love the inclusion of the original DITR2 diffs as lawless ones, really demonstrates just how far Phoenix has progressed!
