review: "We're happy to present this map as an astounding achievement that we feel deserves to be recognised. The lighting is excellent, and the maps (including a modchart courtesy of Jafdy) are a ton of fun with a good level of craftsmanship. There's certainly a lot of effort involved in wrangling together a group of mappers to produce a polished product, but the work certainly paid off."
