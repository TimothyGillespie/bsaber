review: |-
  Each section has it's own flow and speed, thus it never gets bored - something thats really non trivial with a 12 minute map + having a full spread of difficulties.

  The dedication of the artists on this map shows that although Beat Saber by itself is a good game , what makes it GREAT and worth while past the first 15 minute hype is the MODDERS community with thier creative thinking, thus expanding the games potential anew each time !

  Keep up the amazing work :) !
