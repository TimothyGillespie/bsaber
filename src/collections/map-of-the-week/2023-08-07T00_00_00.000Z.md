review: 'Two excellent top difficulties with super fun representation from both mappers! Great use of the v3 elements (arcs and chains) along with the bomb resets in both difficulties. Fun techier patterns in the top two difficulties, with more accessible ones in the lower difficulties. Awesome lightshow in the Lizzo environment as well, which fits the song perfectly!'
