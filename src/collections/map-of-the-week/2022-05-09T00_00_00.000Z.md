review: 'This map stands out for its great mapping that gives off an amazing dance vibe, incredible vanilla lightshow from AkaBaka that  beautifully represents the song and lower diffs from Timeweaver that keep the same amount of engagement as the uppers! The bombs throughout the map are also a really nice touch.'
