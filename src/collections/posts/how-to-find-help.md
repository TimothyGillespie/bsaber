Are you having trouble and you cannot figure out yourself? Knowing where to ask will give you the quickest resolution without being sent to another server prior. This guide will provide some orientation for you. One thing will become very apparent very quickly though: The core of the Beat Saber Community is to be found on Discord.

# Etiquette

Whenever you seek out help and someone helps you they are doing this in their free time for no payment while having no obligation towards you. It is purely out of the kindness of their heart. Keep that in mind. What you can do to create a more productive and well-meaning interaction is the following:

## 1. Google the Issue You Are Encountering

Perhaps, you can already solve your issue at this stage. If you cannot find anything or get stuck it is a good time to reach out.

It is generally a good idea to mention that you have searched and perhaps how you have searched for your issue prior and that you only came up on outdated or no information. You likely find that people are more willing to help you when they do not feel like they are being used as your google substitution and see the effort on your part.

## 2. Do Not Demand or Bash Anything With Your Request

When it comes to support for mods, a website or a service someone in the community will likely have written that. Insulting it or venting your frustation about it not going to go over well with the person who has spent many hours of their free time on it without compensation, and frankly they are your best bet since they have written it.

After all, despite your frustrating experience you apparently want to use said software - the option of not using it is always open to you.

## 3. Provide All Needed Information

When your are reaching out for help you should try your best to provide all the information that may be necessary up front. Whoever helps you does not want guess what you may want or ask you every small detail. This may lead to finding no response since everybody is just looking on confused. Being clear in the issue will help everyone involved a lot. Consider the context that everyone else will have as well.

If, for example, your BeatSaver map wrongly got marked as an AI map do not just say

> My map was marked as AI

but rather try:

> My map was marked as AI, but I have mapped it myself with no help from any AI. Could that be corrected? Here is the Map link: https://beatsaver.com/maps/1c00

## 4. Do Not Target Specific People With Your Request

It can be tempting to ping or DM someone directly when you see them being very knowledgable or active in the support channel. However, that is often not well preceived so I would discourage anyone from doing that unless you know they are okay with that. It may be warranted at times such as when you are seeking out a developer of a specific software. Keep in mind to be respectful towards them and their work in these situations and consider [silent pinging](https://www.reddit.com/r/Discord_/comments/10xak99/silent_messages/#:~:text=Simply%20type%20%22%40silent%22%20(,%2C%20including%20Reply%2DPings%20too.) them.

## 5. Say Thank You

It may be small, but dropping out of it with a thank you at whoever helped you is not too much to ask.

# Mod Support

When it comes to issues with mods and the ModAssistant your best bet will be the [Beat Saber Modding Group (BSMG) Discord](discord.gg/beatsabermods).

BSMG also offers ressources and instruction on how to mod your game. If all you need is that you will find that [in the BSMG wiki](https://bsmg.wiki/beginners-guide.html).

They provide help for users having issues or questions with mods. To find the appropriate channel you first need to know what your platform is.

## Determining Your Platform

Generally, we differentiate among two different platforms that can be modded. Namely, PC and Quest (Standalone).

Your platform is PC, when you connect your headset with the computer and your BeatSaber installation is purchased and started through steam. Even if you are connecting your Quest device to the computer.

Your platform is Quest (standalone) if you have a Quest device and you do not connect it to the computer. The game is running directly on your Quest.

## BSMG Channels for Support

Note: You must have joined the BSMG Discord for some of these links to work.

In [#pc-help](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/442696229508612096) you will find help as a mod user on the PC platform.

In [#quest-help](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/599740612752703490) you will find help as a mod user on the Quest (standalone) platform.

## Find Help as a Mod Developer

**ONLY USE THESE CHANNELS IF YOU ARE A MOD DEVELOPER AND WRITE CODE**.

The following channels are not support channels but a place for mod developers to exchange the experience and knowledge and are used to reach out for help with certain issues. Do keep in mind that their primary function is not to help people developing mods, but to be a general discussion of development.

[#pc-mod-dev](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/443146108420620318) for PC mod development.

[#quest-mod-dev](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/583108561396170837) for Quest (standalone) mod development.
